# Contributing to Dendro-GR

Thank you for your interest in helping contribute to Dendro-GR. See our README.md file for information on how to build and run the program.

When contributing, please feel free to use the repository [issues](https://github.com/paralab/Dendro-GR/issues) tracker. This includes suggestions, bugs, and otherwise.

## Actively Contributing

If you are an active contributor, we use the Fork model when developing. Each developer should create their own personal fork where they can test, develop, and play with without affecting this repository.

Once a feature, bug-fix, or improvement is ready, please create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/paralab/Dendro-GR/pulls). You'll be able to select your fork and branch that you want to merge into the main project there.

When preparing the Pull Request, it is important that no additional files (especially non-source code files!) are added to the repository. Make sure there are no artifacts, binaries, or other non-necessary files included.

Please be sure to include all relevant information about the improvements made. We also would appreciate it if the included code is formatted via `clang-format`, we have a repository-wide format file in the root of the repository.

## Did you find a bug?

If you found a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/paralab/Dendro-GR/issues).
